# CineSeek Movie Discovery Application

## API Overview

The MoviesDatabase API provides complete and updated data for over 9 million titles (movies, series and episodes) and 11 million actors/crew and cast members. This comprehensive movie database API offers detailed information about films, TV shows, actors, and includes additional features like YouTube trailer URLs, awards information, and full biographies. The API serves as the backbone for CineSeek, enabling users to discover and explore movies with rich metadata and filtering capabilities.

## Version

The MoviesDatabase API is currently available through RapidAPI Hub as a RESTful web service. The API is actively maintained and regularly updated with new content and features.

## Available Endpoints

The MoviesDatabase API provides several key endpoints for accessing movie and entertainment data:

- **/titles** - Main endpoint for fetching movie and TV show data
  - Supports filtering by year, genre, and other parameters
  - Implements pagination for browsing through large result sets
  - Returns comprehensive title information including images, release dates, and metadata

- **/titles/{id}** - Retrieve detailed information for a specific title
  - Provides full movie/show details, cast, crew, and additional metadata
  - Includes trailer URLs, awards, and comprehensive biographical information

- **/titles/search** - Search functionality for finding specific titles
  - Allows text-based searching across the movie database
  - Supports various search parameters and filters

- **/actors** - Access information about actors and crew members
  - Provides biographical information and filmography
  - Includes images and career details

## Request and Response Format

### Request Structure
All API requests require authentication via RapidAPI headers and follow RESTful conventions:

```
GET https://moviesdatabase.p.rapidapi.com/titles?year=2024&sort=year.decr&limit=12&page=1&genre=Comedy
```

**Required Headers:**
- `x-rapidapi-host: moviesdatabase.p.rapidapi.com`
- `x-rapidapi-key: YOUR_API_KEY`

### Response Format
The API returns JSON responses with a consistent structure:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "tt1234567",
      "titleText": {
        "text": "Movie Title"
      },
      "primaryImage": {
        "url": "https://image-url.jpg"
      },
      "releaseYear": {
        "year": "2024"
      }
    }
  ],
  "page": 1,
  "total": 1000
}
```

## Authentication

The MoviesDatabase API uses API key authentication through RapidAPI:

1. **Registration**: Sign up for a RapidAPI account
2. **Subscription**: Subscribe to the MoviesDatabase API (free tier available)
3. **API Key**: Obtain your unique API key from the RapidAPI dashboard
4. **Headers**: Include the required headers in all requests:
   - `x-rapidapi-host: moviesdatabase.p.rapidapi.com`
   - `x-rapidapi-key: YOUR_API_KEY`

**Security Best Practices:**
- Store API keys in environment variables (`.env.local`)
- Use server-side API routes to protect client-side exposure
- Never commit API keys to version control

## Error Handling

The API returns standard HTTP status codes and error responses:

### Common HTTP Status Codes:
- **200 OK** - Successful request
- **400 Bad Request** - Invalid request parameters
- **401 Unauthorized** - Invalid or missing API key
- **403 Forbidden** - Rate limit exceeded or access denied
- **404 Not Found** - Resource not found
- **500 Internal Server Error** - Server-side error

### Error Response Format:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": 400,
    "message": "Invalid request parameters"
  }
}
```

### Recommended Error Handling:
- Implement try/catch blocks in API routes
- Check response status codes before processing data
- Use type guards for API data validation
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Implement loading states for better UX

## Usage Limits and Best Practices

### Rate Limits:
- Free tier: Limited requests per month
- Paid tiers: Higher request limits available
- Implement request throttling to avoid hitting limits

### Best Practices:
1. **Pagination**: Use pagination parameters to limit request size (recommended: 12-50 items per page)
2. **Caching**: Implement client-side caching for frequently accessed data
3. **Error Boundaries**: Use React error boundaries for graceful failure handling
4. **Loading States**: Always provide loading indicators during API calls
5. **Debouncing**: Implement debouncing for search functionality to reduce API calls
6. **Efficient Filtering**: Use API parameters for filtering rather than client-side filtering
7. **Image Optimization**: Use Next.js Image component for optimized image loading
8. **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive configuration in environment variables

### Performance Optimization:
- Minimize API calls by batching requests when possible
- Use appropriate page sizes for pagination
- Implement infinite scrolling or pagination for large datasets
- Consider implementing a caching strategy for static data

### Development Considerations:
- Test API endpoints thoroughly during development
- Monitor API usage to stay within limits
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for API responses
- Use proper error handling and loading states throughout the application
